Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 

a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 

Bridgecrew : The Bridgecrew platform automates security engineering, allowing teams to identify and fix misconfigurations in run-time and build-time automatically.

Example 1 :

Ensure S3 Bucket BlockPublicPolicy is set to True
Severity: 
MEDIUM
   |   
Policy ID: BC_AWS_S3_20
   |   
Benchmarks: PCI-DSS V3.2.1(1.3, 2.2), FEDRAMP (MODERATE)(AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-21(b), SC-7, SC-7(3))

Example 2 : 

Ensure AWS Security Group does not allow all traffic on SSH port 22

Severity: 
CRITICAL
   |

   |   
Benchmarks: SOC2(CC6.3.3), PCI-DSS V3.2(2), HIPAA(164.312(E)(1)), NIST-800-53(AC-17, CA-3, CA-9, CM-3, SC-2), ISO27001(A.10.1.1


b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. 

Tool is Anchore

OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities 
Common vulnerabilities and exposures or CVE findings
Crypto Mining Checks


c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.

Tool : AWS Security Hub
Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level
S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
