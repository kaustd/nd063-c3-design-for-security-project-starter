Identify Bad Practices


Item 1 : 

Load Balancer named c1-web-service-alb is using a listener on port 80 named HTTP : 80
We should not be allowing our public facing web service applications to be accessed through port 80.
Rather the listener should be created for port 443 and HTTPS protocol.

Item 2 :

Security group for this application server-WebAppSG

The inbound rules allows traffic from all IP addresses and all protocols. 
Large port ranges, when open, expose the instances to unwanted attacks. More than that, they make traceability of vulnerabilities very difficult.
We should limit the ingress and egress ports and protocol to a limited list that is required for our web application.
