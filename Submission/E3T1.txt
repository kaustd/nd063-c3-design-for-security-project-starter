#What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?

i-0edcbf672280a9dc0 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.94. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources.

In our the severity is high because the EC2 instance is from our workload that is being used to perform the brute force attack.
This finding's severity would have been low if a brute force attack is aimed at one of your EC2 instance but not from one of our EC2 instance.
