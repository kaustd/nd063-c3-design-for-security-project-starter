++IAM Password Policy Requires to be strong : Multiple Recommendations

Configure a strong password policy for your users

Rules for setting a password policy
The IAM password policy does not apply to the AWS account root user password or IAM user access keys. If a password expires, the IAM user can't sign in to the AWS Management Console but can continue to use their access keys.

When you create or change a password policy, most of the password policy settings are enforced the next time your users change their passwords. However, some of the settings are enforced immediately. For example:

When the minimum length and character type requirements change, these settings are enforced the next time that your users change their passwords. Users are not forced to change their existing passwords, even if the existing passwords do not adhere to the updated password policy.

When you set a password expiration period, the expiration period is enforced immediately. For example, assume that you set a password expiration period of 90 days. In that case, the password expires for all IAM users whose existing password is older than 90 days. Those users are required to change their password the next time that they sign in.
